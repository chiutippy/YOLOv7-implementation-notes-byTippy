# YOLOv7-implementation-notes-byTippy
It's a implementation notes of YOLOv7 by Tippy.
## Notes
In addition to documenting the implementation process of YOLOv7, I also developed a script called **binary2txt.py**, which converts binary 2D images into the text format required by YOLOv7. Moreover, in **MN_YOLOv7_predict_byT.py**, I stored the results in **MAT** format, enabling calculations for segmentation, classification, and mPQ metrics using this [script](https://github.com/chiutippy/Maskrcnn-implementation-byTippy/blob/main/MN_metrics_byT.py).
